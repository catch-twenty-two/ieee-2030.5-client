/** @defgroup retrieve Retrieve

    The retrieve module provides high level methods to retrieve resources from
    IEEE 2030.5 servers. These methods use a placeholder called a Stub to track
    the state of retrieval and provide local storage for a resource. The Stubs
    can be linked together to create and manage hierarchies of both dependent
    and required resources.

    When a resource and all of its subordinates are fully and successfully
    retrieved then the resource is considered complete, this condition is
    monitored by the retrieval algorithm and can optionally signal a user
    supplied routine using the resource as a parameter.
